# Classification_C2H4_ICT
* This is for the codes for this study of ML prediction of reaction-types of ion-molecule collisions.
* The codes are verified for Scikit-learn 1.3.0 and TensorFlow 2.12.0 versions.
* Python 3.8 is used.
  Description:
  An exploration into leveraging machine learning techniques, including deep neural networks and RNNs, for quantum dynamical studies. This repository contains our novel approaches to classify reaction types and predict charges in ICT processes using the PACE coding suite. Demonstrates ML's potential in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of ion-molecule collisional dynamics research.
Repository Architecture:
(i)    Data: Contains  all the data
(ii)   Code: All the functions and modules can be found in this folder.
(iii)  Notebook: Complete codes in the Jupyter-notebooks can be found here.
